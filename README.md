# attiny85-LowPower (0.02µA) 

AVR Atmel ATtiny85 Deep Sleep Low Power mode (~0.02µA) with external interrupt on Arduino.

### Project Goals
The main goal of the project is show how to turn low power sleep mode for ATiny85 in an Arduino environment.
In the sleep mode ATiny85 consumes ~0.02µA for 3V. That's theoretical years of 200mAH CR2032 battery lifetime.

In the Web there are examples how to apply low power sleep mode for ATtiny85, e.g. [technoblogy: ATtiny Low Power](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?KX0).
But these examples use "Reset" to interrupt sleep mode. In this project we use "External Interruption", that allows us to interrupt sleep mode without 
reset the microcontroller and in the result keep program state.

### Example Description
There is an example implementation of low power sleep mode. There are two LEDs, one green and one red. When a user clicks the push button then the LEDs light up alternately. After that LEDs turn off and ATTiny85 switches to low power mode.

**Notes**

1. Switch button is connected to the `PB2` input. The input is pull-down with 220Ω resistor.
2. Not used inputs are pull-ups with internal resistors.
3. Green and Red LEDs are connected appropriately to `PB0` and `PB1` inputs. 220Ω resistor is used to limit current.

### Code Notes
I couldn't get the desired result with only the Arudino library. I needed to use ATTiny85 registers and assembly code.
